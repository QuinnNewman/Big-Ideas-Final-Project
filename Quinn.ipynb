    "Our project is to figure out which is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh... for rats. My approach is to find which neighborhood is the best for rats by analysising the amount of condemned or dead-end properties in each area, and then factoring in the properties' inspection score into our rating. The reasoning behind this is that if there are alot of condemned buildings that recieved bad inspection scores in a neighborhood, then that area has alot of unkept buildings that are probably run down and trashy. Perfect for rats. Additionaly, if there are lots of condemned buildings in general, that means there would be plently of space for the rats to live in peace."
