    "In this project, we will be determining the best neighborhood in pittsburgh... for rats. This means that many things such as run down properties or health code violations, will be positive things to look for in our ideal neighborhood. Right from the start we decided to go with this metric, as it provides a unique and fun take on what is considered the \"best neighborhood\", we didn't even consider anything else. \n",

    "**The Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what qualifies a neighborhood to be more rat friendly than the others? We decided on 3 things: The amount/quality of condemned or dead-end properties in the area, the amount of pest code violations, and the amount of dog licenses in each neighborhood. Here are the links to the datasets that we are using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Condemned/Dead-end Properties: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/condemned-properties/resource/0a963f26-eb4b-4325-bbbc-3ddf6a871410\n",
    "\n",
    "- Health Code Violations: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-restaurant-food-facility-inspection-violations/resource/1a1329e2-418c-4bd3-af2c-cc334e7559af\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dog Licenses in Area: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-dog-licenses/resource/ecedb5a4-4e9d-469b-8cde-2673ee48c482\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose these metrics because they represent 3 very important aspects of life for a rat. First, rats need shelter to live in and be safe. An area with many trashy properties would provide plenty of shelter for the rats to live in. Second, rats need to be able to eat food and thrive. Therefore, analyzing the amount of pest related health code violations in the local restaurants will show us where rats can live to easily grab a bite to eat. Lastly, rats need to live safely. That's why we will also be taking the amount of dog licenses into account, so we can find the best neighborhood where rats won't have to worry about being snatched up or eaten when they let their guard down. Overall, our approach to find the best possible neighborhood for rats will be whichever neighborhood has the highest average ranking between our 3 important sub-metrics. Let's begin!\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to figure out which neighborhood has the best places to live for rats, we will need to find a ratio between the amount of condemned/dead-end properties and the total inspection scores which rate the severity of the propertie's health violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we will find the average inspection score of the condemned properties in each neighborhood, but there is one thing we will need to take into account. Specifically, if we are going to use the average, we need to make sure that neighborhoods with few properties in gerneral are removed from our list. This is because we cant decide that a neighborhood is the best just because it has 5 really bad properties in the whole area. The rats need places to live, and for that reason, any neighborhoods with less than 75 condemned properties arent eligible to be considered the best."
